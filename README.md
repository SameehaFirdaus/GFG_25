## 💡 **Problem Description:**

Geek has an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `i`-th event. The array `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`.

Geek wants to add a new interval `newInterval = [newStart, newEnd]` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and has no overlapping intervals. Merge overlapping intervals if necessary.


## 🔍 **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**  
`intervals = [[1,3], [4,5], [6,7], [8,10]], newInterval = [5,6]`  
**Output:**  
`[[1,3], [4,7], [8,10]]`

**Explanation:**  
The `newInterval` `[5,6]` overlaps with `[4,5]` and `[6,7]`, so they are merged into `[4,7]`.


**Input:**  
`intervals = [[1,2], [3,5], [6,7], [8,10], [12,16]], newInterval = [4,9]`  
**Output:**  
`[[1,2], [3,10], [12,16]]`

**Explanation:**  
The `newInterval` `[4,9]` overlaps with `[3,5], [6,7], [8,10]`, so they are merged into `[3,10]`.


### Constraints:

- $`1 ≤ intervals.size() ≤ 10^5`$  
- $`0 ≤ start[i], end[i] ≤ 10^9`$


## 🎯 **My Approach:**

1. **Iterative Merge:**  
   - Traverse the intervals and add those that come entirely before the `newInterval`.  
   - Merge intervals that overlap with `newInterval`.  
   - Add intervals that come entirely after `newInterval`.  

2. **Steps:**  
   - Traverse through the given intervals:
     - If an interval ends before the `newInterval` starts, add it to the result.  
     - If an interval starts after the `newInterval` ends, add the `newInterval` to the result and process the current interval as the next `newInterval`.  
     - Otherwise, merge overlapping intervals by updating the start and end of the `newInterval`.  
   - Append the last `newInterval` to the result after traversal.

3. **Efficiency:**  
   - The approach involves a single traversal of the array, making it optimal.  
   - Merging intervals is straightforward and uses a constant amount of additional space.


## 🕒 **Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity** 

**Expected Time Complexity:**  
O(n), where `n` is the size of the intervals. Traversal through all intervals ensures linear time complexity.

**Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:**  
O(n), as we store the resulting intervals in a new list.

## 📝 **Solution Code**

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def insertInterval(self, intervals, newInterval):
        result = []
        for interval in intervals:
            if interval[1] < newInterval[0]:
                result.append(interval)
            elif interval[0] > newInterval[1]:
                result.append(newInterval)
                newInterval = interval
            else:
                newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], interval[0])
                newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], interval[1])
        result.append(newInterval)
        return result
```
